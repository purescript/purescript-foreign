## [v7.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v7.0.0) - 2022-04-27

Breaking changes:
- Migrate FFI to ES modules (#86 by @kl0tl and @JordanMartinez)

New features:

Bugfixes:

Other improvements:
- Replace all usages of `F` and `FT` with `Except`/`ExceptT (NonEmptyList ForeignError)` (#87 by @JordanMartinez)

  Often times, the `F` and `FT` aliases did more to hinder usage of this library than help. These aliases
  haven't been deprecated, but usage of them is now discouraged. All code in the library now uses
  the full type that is aliased by `F` and `FT`.

## [v6.0.1](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v6.0.1) - 2021-04-20

Other improvements:
- Fix warnings revealed by v0.14.1 PureScript release (#85 by @JordanMartinez)

## [v6.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v6.0.0) - 2021-02-26

Breaking changes:
- Added support for PureScript 0.14 and dropped support for all previous versions (#80)

Other improvements:
- Migrated CI to GitHub Actions and updated installation instructions to use Spago (#81)
- Added a CHANGELOG.md file and pull request template (#82, #83)
- Replaced `unsafeToForeign` and `unsafeFromForeign` with `unsafeCoerce` (#72)

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v5.0.0) - 2018-05-24

- Updated for PureScript 0.12
- `renderForeignError` now renders nested errors correcty (@abhin4v)
- The namespace is now `Foreign` rather than `Data.Foreign`
- The `JSONError` constructor was removed. This library is not for JSON, it was a bad name - use `ForeignError` instead.
- `toForeign` has been renamed as `unsafeToForeign` with a comment explaining its intended usage and potential risks

## [v4.0.1](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v4.0.1) - 2017-06-08

Fix `Show` instance for `ForeignError` (@rightfold)

## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v4.0.0) - 2017-03-29

- Updated for PureScript 0.11
- The library has been drastically simplified to focus on its core use; validating and extracting data from foreign values. This involves changes such as:
    - Removal of `IsForeign` / `AsForeign` classes
    - Removal of `parseJSON` as this library is not intended for general JSON parsing
- New functions were added for `readNull`, `readUndefined`, `readNullOrUndefined` rather than using the newtypes to direct `IsForeign` choice as it was before
- The `(!)` index/property reading operator has been enhanced to work with `Foreign` or `F Foreign` on the left hand side, allowing for chained property reads

## [v3.2.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v3.2.0) - 2017-01-29

Add instances for `Null`, `Undefined` and `NullOrUndefined` (@felixSchl)

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2016-10-13

- Updated dependecies
- `F` now uses `Except` and allows for the accumulation of multiple errors when using `<|>` in parsing

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2016-08-09

- Added `AsForeign` class and combinators for writing values as `Foreign` (@puffnfresh)

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2016-06-01

This release is intended for the PureScript 0.9.1 compiler and newer.

**Note**: The v1.0.0 tag is not meant to indicate the library is “finished”, the core libraries are all being bumped to this for the 0.9 compiler release so as to use semver more correctly.
